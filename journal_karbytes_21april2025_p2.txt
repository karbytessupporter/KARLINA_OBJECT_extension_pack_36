What I hope (and expect) is that the next addition I make to karbytes is going to be a new addition to the SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING_PORTFOLIO section of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com (and that section is located at the following Uniform Resource Locator (URL): https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/software_engineering_portfolio/) and I hope and expect that there will actually be a genuinely karbytes-approved (and karbytes-initiated) addition to the karbytes intellectual property collection (encompassed by the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com (which is located at the following URL: https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/) and the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com (which is located at the following URL: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/)).
