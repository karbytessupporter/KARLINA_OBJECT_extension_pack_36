<p>This web page is a follow-up the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator:</p>
<p><a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/why_do_people_think_men_are_clearly_better_than_females/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/why_do_people_think_men_are_clearly_better_than_females/</a></p>

<p>The Quora screenshot featured on this web page depicts the following quote:</p>
<p>&#8220;Man is defined as a human being and woman is defined as a female. Whenever she tries to behave as a human being she is accused of trying to emulate the male.</p>
<p>â€” Simone de Beauvoir&#8221;</p>
<p>I personally agree with that quote more than I disagree with it based on my remembered experiences of witnessing myself and other female-bodied humans being discouraged and even punished (sometimes in a brutal way) for the &#8220;crime&#8221; of acting like a man or, at the very least, not acting like a submissive-to-the-patriarchy sheltered ninny who seems to have no goals other than appeasing the patriarchy (i.e. being preoccupied with how &#8220;she&#8221; appears to cisgendered heterosexual men (particularly as a sex object and prospective mating partner) and assuming the role of designated care-taker of people other than herself and, also, not seeming to have much knowledge nor expertise in domains other than purely socializing and appeasing people in accordance to the patriarchy).</p>
<p>In the older web page which I referenced in this relatively new web page, I took the side of &#8220;misogynists&#8221; and credited having unnaturally high testosterone levels as setting me apart from &#8220;typical wimmin&#8221;. In all honesty I feel more hatred towards men than towards women (especially due to the fact that I have gathered what I think is sufficient evidence to believe than men used physical coercion to keep women in a subordinate and &#8220;inferior&#8221; position to men for most of recorded human history (at least up to a certain point in the timeline of human civilization).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">I have noticed that women often get praised for complying with the stereotype that, because they are women, they are not &#8220;supposed&#8221; to be as smart, stoic, and physically strong as men. I have also noticed that women get belittled, ignored, or even punished for not complying with that stereotype. Overall, I think that systemic favoritism towards men and normalized widespread belittlement of women has practically forced many (if not most) female-bodied humans into complying with the patriarchy in the aforementioned manner.</span> Hence, because such female-bodied humans were basically tortured into compliance with the patriarchy, I feel that it is more appropriate to blame men for why women seem to be dumber, more emotionally disorganized, and physically weak than men (though I feel that it is appropriate and necessary to hold women accountable for such deficiencies to some extent (especially if those women (or female-bodied humans) live in &#8220;first world countries&#8221; where they generally have the same legal rights as their male-bodied counterparts)).</p>
<p>So, to summarize what I am saying, female-bodied humans generally get demonized by male-bodied humans (and the female-bodied humans which subordinate themselves to the patriarchy) for attempting to act like beings with intrinsic worth (instead of extrinsic worth only) and self-esteem earned through accomplishing feats which men are generally praised for and known for doing.</p>
<p>A rather trivial but recent example from my personal life I can cite for such antics is when I was busily conversing with ChatGPT while drafting a <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/chatgpt_karbytes_20april2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">note</a> for my blog and while taking a walk through some neighborhoods near where I legally live at approximately 1:00AM Pacific Standard Time. Boys in loud cars tend to drive around that area quickly and in a manner which looks to me like patrolling &#8220;their&#8221; territory. When they saw me walking along and talking to ChatGPT, they drove past me several times and seemed to be annoyed that I was in &#8220;their&#8221; territory during &#8220;their&#8221; time. It&#8217;s like the boys of the &#8216;hood get are the only people allowed to stay outside late and to make loud noises in general. I also noticed that some men seem to bully me in an attempt to induce me to have an outburst or panic attack whenever I simply mind my own business in pertinence to what I consider to be a milestone of a creative accomplishment. Finally, I noticed that some men seem to stalk me (rather obsessively) and essentially demand that I stop what I am doing to acknowledge their presence and to show them submissiveness (and they too act like I am offending them merely by having my own solitary hobbies which absorb my attention and bring me a sense of self-esteem).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">One of the main reasons why I voluntarily choose to be celibate and asocial is because I think too many people (and society in general) condones the kind of sexism I described in this web page.</span> I have met some rare exceptions but such people seem to live in more culturally liberal and educated places than where I currently reside. It seems that, in order for me to maintain my dignity, I need to keep these thoughts &#8220;on the down low&#8221; as much as possible and to pretend I do not know anything other than the patriarchal status quo which seems to be the overwhelming norm in the region where I live. Hence, this note (like the aforementioned prequel note) is relegated to the portion of karbytes referred to as <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/box_of_gems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;box_of_gems&#8221;</a>.</p>

<p>On second thought, I decided to include this web page&#8217;s source code as a file in the karbytes-owned GitHub repository named <a style="background: #00ff00;color: #000000" href="https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_36/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_36</a>. I was initially reluctant to do so because I thought that doing so would further jeopardize my already jeopardized social (and even legal) reputation; thereby further hindering my ability to obtain and keep employment. (I have reason to believe that I am being prevented from becoming financially independent because I have been so outspoken in my beliefs about the patriarchy and in my criticisms of the society I live in). Despite the known risks I am taking by daring to showcase this web page more prominently in my blog, I feel greater peace of mind doing so because I want this note to be relatively easy to find so that as many people as possible as quickly as possible can benefit from its messages. I think that this web page fills a niche which few media items currently do (given that most media seems to pander to a patriarchal paradigm even while purporting to be pro female empowerment).</p>
